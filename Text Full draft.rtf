\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this draft of my soundscape project I tell the story of someone who is walking in the woods when out of nowhere a thunderstorm starts. During the thunderstorm when the person is running a lighting bolt strikes a tree and it falls down infant of them as they are running back to find shelter. At the end of the sound they finally make it to shelter and it ends. The two screenshots shows a lot of progress from my original as the original just had the sounds inputted in Audacity, and now in these two the show them in order with effects of making the sounds louder/fade in and out.  }
